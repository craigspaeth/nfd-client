# What is NoFeeDigs?

NoFeeDigs is a free, user-friendly, quick and efficient search tool to help you (NYC renters) find an affordable New York City apartment, without the hassle of dealing with pushy brokers, and without paying an absurd broker's fee (which can be over one month's rent!).

# Why no fee listings?

Finding an apartment to rent in New York City is one of the most stressful things a person can do. There is extremely fast turnover, tons of paperwork, and small windows of opportunity. However, those willing to put in the effort to find an apartment on their own are faced with unnecessary obstacles from hard to use services and dishonest real estate agents. New York City brokers are frequently scamming renters and flooding listings on websites like Craigslist pretending to be landlords in hopes to lure renters into contacting them and then will charge the renters a steep and an unnecessary broker's fee.

Another frustration with brokers is that many of them will often pull a common tactic called the bait-and-switch where they will post unavailable apartments or listings that simply don't exist. When renters call to inquire about these listings brokers will make up a story about what happened to the fake apartment (usually by saying it was already taken) and will offer to show renters other available apartments instead (which surprise, surpriseâ€¦ come attached with a broker's fee). Bait-and-switch deception and broker's fees altogether are unacceptable. That's why NoFeeDigs encourages renters to view only no fee listings.

# How does NoFeeDigs work?

NoFeeDigs collects no fee listings across the web into one convenient place. On top of that NoFeeDigs has designed an interface that makes it quick and painless to filter no fee listings and help renters focus on specific criteria. The web isn't an honest place for no fee listings in New York, but NoFeeDigs will try to help you find the honest gems amongst them.
